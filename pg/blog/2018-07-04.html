                    <p>The story begins back in 2011, when I worked at the University of Technology - Department of
                        Computer Sciences, I was a Lab. supervisor and assigned to teach Oracle database and forms
                        developer subject for the 3rd and 4th level students, for anybody who worked with Oracle
                        software knows how tedious the process of installing the Oracle DBMS and the forms Builder
                        especially on Windows machines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I saw the trouble and headache that the students go through trying to install and run the
                        Oracle software system on their laptops, so I thought the best way to do this by making videos
                        about it, this made things easy for me for the installation process requires many steps and
                        configurations it was not practical to give a lecture about it or to explain the process with
                        each student for the long time it takes, so recording videos idea seemed perfect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So I used a screen capture software to record the installation process with all the steps
                        required, with my voice commenting on every single step, I decided not to show my face on the
                        videos for two reasons: the first one was I didn’t have a good web cam. at the moment and the
                        second one was my laziness, for if I was to record myself then I would have to worry about
                        dressing good, wash my face, adjust my hair and all that unnecessary stuff :)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I created a YouTube channel and uploaded the videos and gave the links to the students, The
                        students liked the idea and Oracle Installation problem was solved once and for all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As I was preparing the lectures for the Oracle Lab. subjects, encouraged by the acceptance of
                        the Oracle installation videos, I thought why not recording the material for these lectures, it
                        seemed a good idea for many reasons, one of them is to make an archive of lectures for me as a
                        future reference that I can get back to at any time, the students can benefit greatly from this
                        because the lectures are accessible at any time the student want, if the student could not make
                        it to the lecture at that day, he/she can catch up with the rest of the class by watching the
                        video, another fundamental point is that I believe that all students can learn anything the
                        difference between one another is the pace they learn with, I mean every individual student has
                        his/her own speed of learning subjects, some students gets it from the first time the teacher
                        give the lectures, others need to focus more they need the lecture to be repeated, and this can
                        be done by videos the student now can watch the lecture any time he/she want, the lecture can
                        be paused, repeated, most importantly the lecture now can be watched before it given in class.
                        As students preparing for their exams they don’t have to worry about how the teacher explained
                        a specific subject, the lectures are there forever, thanks to Google.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the years rolled by I admired the Khan Academy story, I admired Salman Khan who is the
                        creator of Khan academy I saw all of his speeches, read his book, watched a great deal of his
                        videos in math during my master’s study it helped me greatly. I was inspired by him I consider
                        him my role model, I liked the way he layout the lecture his intelligent way to give it in a
                        friendly manner with nice sense of humor which is always good. the humbleness he has, made me
                        realize that our way of giving lectures is wrong. I realized that in order to give a lecture we
                        have to give it from our hearts with joy and in a fun way this will reach the student's mind
                        and
                        touch his/her heart. and I know as a fact if you are a good teacher and you want to benefit
                        your students, make them love the subject you teach.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now I teach programming in C++ and all the lectures I gave are recorded on YouTube for anyone
                        to benefit from, and I made to myself a promise to keep doing this as long as I see it brings
                        benefit to students, I have a great feedback from my students, well I feel that I helped them I
                        saw how their grades are improving and most importantly they started to love programming (well
                        some of them not I hope to change that) and that is enough for me to know that I did a good job
                        at least.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The video recording process is tiring and it need a lot of work and preparations, and I become
                        lazy sometimes or loaded with responsibilities at work, troubles of life and other things but
                        always with the thought of coming back to sit down and just make videos.
